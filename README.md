# Pf2e Display Actions

Displays Pathfinder2e action and reaction buttons.

## Usage

Click on this Button in the actors tab. ![Button in the actors tab](usage.png)

This should get you your action display ![action display dialog](dialog.png)

Simply change the number in the fields to the desired amount.

### Options
Everything below can be tweaked in the settings
### Duplicate
creates a copy of your window, maybe useful for saving configurations.
### Show Players
Opens another another dialog inwhich you can send your dialog to another player at the table. Or send it straight into the chat
### Link to Actor
Fixes your Actions to that of the actor linked to the window. (Influenced by slowed, quickened, ...)
Currently WIP I may have missed many interactions.

## Roadmap
- make the amount of actions and reactions based on the selected token
    - include better handling
- beautify the Dialog
- better titles
